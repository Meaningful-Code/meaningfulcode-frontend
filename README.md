## Build

### Stack

The project uses:

- Frontend: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with App router, [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) with Typescript.
- Backend (available separately): Node & Express (Typescript), AWS Lambda & DynamoDB.
- Hosting: the full solution currently runs on Vercel.

The rest of the instructions on this page focus on the frontend.

### Setup

The following steps guide you to setup your environment:

1. Install [Node 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
1. Install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)
1. Clone this repository, and run `yarn install`

### Run locally without the backend

1. Configure the frontend to use local stub data by creating a `.env.local` file containing

   ```
   REACT_APP_FORCE_API=stub
   ```

2. Run the development server with `yarn dev`. You should see:

   ```
   yarn run v1.22.19
   $ next dev
   ▲ Next.js 14.0.4
   - Local:        http://localhost:3000
   - Environments: .env.local

   ✓ Ready in 1059ms
   ```

### Run locally with the backend

Note that the backend (`src/app/api`) is not available publicly for security reasons.

1. Checkout the `api` submodule: `git submodule update --init`

2. Set the appropriate environment variables in `.env.local` and add

   ```
   MEANINGFUL_DEV=1
   ```

3. Run with `yarn dev`.

#### Environment variables

- `REACT_APP_FORCE_API` environment variable can be set to

  - `stub`,
  - `local`, API expected at `http://localhost:3001`,
  - or `prod`.

- `MEANINGFUL_DEV` forces using `localhost` for API endpoints

### Production build

To test a production build, simply run:

1. `yarn build`
1. `npm install -g serve`
1. `serve -s build`
